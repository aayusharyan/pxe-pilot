#!ipxe
# Stage 1 (build time): baked into undionly.kpxe. Does not reference the HTTP app.
# Client has just loaded this binary via TFTP; we only tell it to TFTP-load boot.ipxe from the same server.
# boot.ipxe is generated at container startup (entrypoint.sh) and contains the HTTP /chain URL.
# ${next-server} is set by DHCP option 66 (router "TFTP Server" / siaddr); same host as this container.
